# PART A — EXECUTIVE & STRATEGY

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document is the **single source of truth** for the Bright Tutor platform. It defines:

- **End-to-end scope** (A–Z) for Guardian (Parent) Web & App, Teacher Web & App, CRO Console, and Admin Panel.
- **Stakeholders, roles, permissions** (RBAC).
- **System architecture, technology stack rationale**, and design.
- **Modules, features, and detailed requirements** (functional & non-functional).
- **User stories, user journeys, and flows** with visual diagrams.
- **Engines** (Status, Task, Payment, Refund, Bonus, Lock, Ribbon).
- **Delivery roadmap** and acceptance criteria.

It consolidates:

- Figma prototypes (Bright Tutor App, Bright Tutor Admin Panel).
- Internal specs (status engine, payment, ribbon, bonus, workflows).
- Prior scope/SRS drafts.

**Audience:** Client, Product Owners, Designers, Engineers, QA, DevOps.

### 1.3 MVP / Phase-01 – Client-Provided Integrations & Current Process

For **MVP/Phase-01**, the client will provide the following external providers and integrations. These replace the current manual process (Excel/sheets) and are required for go-live.

| Provider / Integration | Purpose | Notes |
|------------------------|---------|--------|
| **IP call provider** | Inbound/outbound calls for CRO/Manager; caller ID capture | When a guardian calls the business number, the call is received via IP; the system shall receive caller number and optionally auto-populate the tuition create form. |
| **SSLCommerz** | Payment gateway | Online payment collection (e.g. Guardian pays 7d/30d/partial via web/app). Client provides credentials and sandbox/live config. |
| **SMS provider (e.g. Teletalk)** | SMS notifications and OTP | Used for reminders, alerts, and OTP; client provides API/credentials. |
| **Others as needed** | Push, social posting, etc. | Any additional providers required for Phase-01 will be supplied or approved by the client. |

**Current state (pre-platform):** All tuition pipeline, payments, and follow-ups are handled manually in **Excel/sheets**. The platform replaces this with the CRO Console, status/task engine, and integrated payments/communications.

**Lead capture flow (inbound call → tuition creation):**

1. Guardian calls the business number (advertised number).
2. Manager/CRO receives the call **via IP call provider** (softphone or integrated dialer).
3. **Caller number is auto-populated** in the **Tuition Create** form in the Guardian field (primary phone).
4. Manager/CRO asks the guardian: **“Is this your personal number or optional (alternate)?”** and sets:
   - **Primary phone** = main contact (e.g. personal).
   - **Alternate phone** = optional/second number (if provided).
5. Manager/CRO (or designated role) fills the rest of the tuition form: student(s), class, subjects, location, schedule, salary, other requirements, etc.
6. After **all required info is filled**, the form is submitted → tuition is **Created** in the system (status **CREATED**), and the tuition enters the CRO pipeline for broadcast, shortlisting, and further steps as per the master lifecycle.

This flow ensures that every inbound lead from a phone call is captured in the platform with the correct guardian number (primary/alternate) for future call recognition and communication.

**Lead capture – sequence (high level):**

  participant Guardian
  participant IPPhone as IP Call Provider

  participant Form as Tuition Create Form
  participant System as Bright Tutor System

  Guardian->>IPPhone: Calls business number
  IPPhone->>CRO: Incoming call with caller ID
  CRO->>Form: Open Tuition Create
  IPPhone->>Form: Caller number auto-populates in Guardian field
  CRO->>Guardian: Is this personal or optional number?
  Guardian->>CRO: Reply
  CRO->>Form: Set primary and optional phone
  CRO->>Form: Fill student location schedule salary etc
  CRO->>Form: Submit
  Form->>System: Create tuition CREATED
  System->>CRO: Tuition in pipeline
```
